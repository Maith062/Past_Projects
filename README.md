# Past_Projects
A game called "mastermind" that I coded in Java

Objective:
 - the code will create a four colour sequence 
 - users will have to guess if the arrangements of colours they've chosen, is the same as the code-created sequence

A project called "Deck of Cards" that was coded in C++

Objective:
 - the program creates a deck of cards and shuffles it
 - it then splits then deck of cards into two hands, one for each player
 - based on the suits of the cards and the card numbers of each hands it prints out a number
 - it also determines the type of hand of each player
